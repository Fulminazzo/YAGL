The `demo` module is a **special module** that provides a **fully functioning Spigot plugin**.
The main purpose of this module is to provide an actual **test** of **all YAGL features** for the user.

**It should not be used in production environments as there are better solutions for that. 
The only scope is to provide a proof of concept for the library**

`demo` is compatible for **every Minecraft version** listed in the main page, 
and uses a special programming language for all its commands: **Groovy**.

With it, `demo` gives capability to the end user to **view and modify** the code ran upon executing demo commands
**without recompiling the project**, by simply **reloading the plugin**.

All the available commands will be listed in the [resources directory](src/main/resources/commands).
